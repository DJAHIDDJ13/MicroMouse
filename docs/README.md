Here you can find the documentation for the micromouse project.

Make sure you have *latexmk* installed in order to compile the docs
if not run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install latexmk 
```

After you have the required LaTex builder, you can compile the documentation
with the following command:
```
make
```

And to delete the documentation
```
make clean
```
